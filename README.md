# todolist-assignment

This single-page Todo App has been assigned on my interview appointment.
I applied and customized Bootstrap v3 design for this app.
The common functions of the app:
 - Create events
 - Edit events title
 - Delete events from list
 - Change its status to 'completed' or undo back to 'incomplete'
 - Events can be filtered and counted by their status 'allitems', 'incomplete' and 'completed'.
